//! Implementation of the CMP threshold ECDSA signature protocol
//!
//! In a threshold signature scheme, a subset t of n signers, each
//! of whom hold a share of a private signing key, can
//! communicate to produce a valid signature for a message, while
//! any subset of t-1 signers will be unable to forge signatures.
//!
//! A threshold ECDSA signature scheme is specific to the ECDSA
//! signature scheme, where the signatures can be validated by a
//! regular (non-threshold) ECDSA verification function. In fact,
//! signatures generated in this threshold manner are indistinguishable
//! from signatures generated using a normal ECDSA signing method.
//!
//! In this implementation, we instantiate the threshold ECDSA
//! signature scheme described in [CGGMP'21](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060),
//! using [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) as the elliptic curve.
//!
//! Note that this library only provides the low-level interfaces for executing
//! each of the rounds of the protocol, notably without handling communication and
//! parallel execution. The main interfaces allow for a [Participant] to
//! process a message from another participant, producing a set of outgoing messages
//! that in turn must be delivered to other participants.
//!
//! For an example of how to actually integrate this library into a higher-level
//! application that handles the communication between participants in parallel,
//! take a look at the provided [network example](./examples/network/README.md).
//!
//!
