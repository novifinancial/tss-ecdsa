//! # tss-ecdsa: A library for full-threshold ECDSA key generation and signing
//!
//! This work is based on the threshold ECDSA signature scheme described by
//! Canetti et al.[^cite], using `secp256k1`[^curve] as the elliptic curve. The
//! implementation is more limited than the cited protocol in several important
//! ways:
//!
//! 1. It is full-threshold: _all_ participants holding a share of the private
//! key must collaborate to produce a signature.
//!
//! 2. It does not implement key refresh. The paper ties this into the aux-info
//! protocol, but we removed the components that are only used to update the
//! participants' private key shares.
//!
//! 3. It does not implement identifiable abort. That is, the protocol will
//! abort if a party misbehaves, but we did not implement the procedures for
//! identifying which party was responsible.
//!
//!
//! ## Background
//! In a threshold signature scheme, a set of participants derive an asymmetric
//! key pair such that each of them holds only a share of the private signing
//! key, corresponding to a single public verification key. To produce a
//! signature, a group of size at least `t` of the signers can collaborate to
//! produce a valid signature for a message, while any subset of `t-1` signers
//! will be unable to do so (or to forge a valid signature).
//!
//! With the cited threshold ECDSA protocol, signatures are validated by a
//! regular (non-threshold) ECDSA verification function.  In fact, signatures
//! generated in this threshold manner are indistinguishable from signatures
//! generated using a normal ECDSA signing method.
//!
//! # 🔒 Requirements of the calling application
//! This library **does not** implement the complete protocol. There are several
//! security-critical steps that must be handled by the calling application. We
//! leave these undone intentionally, to allow increased flexibility in
//! deploying the library, but this does mean that a successful, correct
//! deployment requires cryptographic expertise to advise on security of the
//! remaining components.
//!
//! These caller requirements are highlighted throughout the documentation with
//! the 🔒 symbol. At a high level, they include:
//!
//! 1. Networking. The protocol requires messages to be sent
//! between the [`Participant`]s, but the library does not implement _any_
//! networking; it simply produces messages to be sent out.
//! See [Networking section](#-networking) below for details, including
//! properties that channels must maintain and validation that the calling
//! application must do.
//!
//! 2. Secure persistent storage. The protocol is composed of four subprotocols,
//! each taking input and returning output. The calling application must persist
//! outputs, provide them as input for subsequent protocol executions, and
//! delete them at the end of their lifetimes. Some outputs are private values
//! that must be stored securely. See [`Participant`] for more details.
//!
//! 3. Identifier creation. To create a [`Participant`], the calling
//! application must specify a session [`Identifier`] and
//! [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s for each party. We do not specify a protocol for
//! creating these; depending on the trust assumptions of the deployment, the
//! caller can select an appropriate protocol that will ensure that all parties
//! agree on the set of identifiers. See [`Identifier`] and
//! [`ParticipantIdentifier`] for more details. They must satisfy several
//! properties:     
//!     1. All identifiers must be consistent across all
//! participants in a session.
//!     2. The session [`Identifier`] must be global and unique;
//! in particular, it must not be reused across multiple protocol
//! instances.
//!     3. The [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s must be unique within the session.
//! A [`ParticipantIdentifier`] assigned to a specific entity can be reused
//! across multiple session by that entity.
//! They should not be reused for different real-world entities; we don't make
//! any guarantees about system behavior when [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s are
//! reused in this way.
//!
//! ## 🔒 Networking
//!
//! The calling application is responsible for sending messages between
//! participants in the protocol.
//! All communication between [`Participant`]s must take place over a
//! channel that satisfies sender authentication and integrity.
//! In practice, this is typically instantiated using a public key
//! infrastructure (PKI) to associate signing keys to entities.
//! Briefly, each message is accompanied by a signature on that message, under
//! the signing key associated with the sending entity.
//! Since the library does not deal directly with communication channels, it
//! does not validate that messages are correctly associated with their sender.
//!
//! Instead, the calling application is responsible for maintaining a mapping
//! between the [`ParticipantIdentifier`] and the signing key associated with
//! each entity. [`Message`]s contain a `from: ParticipantIdentifier` field
//! which specifies the sender of a message. On receiving a message and
//! signature over a channel, the calling application must check that the `from`
//! field in the message matches the signing key used to generate the signature.
//! This ensures that the sender is not lying about its identity.
//!
//! The protocol requires a UC-secure, synchronous, authenticated broadcast
//! channel for use by the [`Participant`]s. Currently, the library handles this
//! automatically by implementing the echo-broadcast protocol described by
//! Goldwasser and Lindell[^echo]. This is the approach the paper mentions,
//! but we emphasize that this reduces the security of the protocol to selective
//! abort[^abort] rather than the stronger notion of identifiable abort that is
//! achieved with an authenticated broadcast protocol.
//!
//!
//! # ⚠️ Security warning
//! The implementation in this crate has not been independently audited for
//! security! We have also not released a version that we have finished
//! internally auditing.
//!
//! At this time, we do not recommend use for security-critical applications.
//! Use at your own risk.
//!
//! # Useful features
//!
//! A [`Participant`] processes messages received from other [`Participant`]s
//! and generates [`Message`] for other  [`Participant`]s to process. When the
//! current sub-protocol finishes, output values are produced.
//!
//! Messages may arrive from the network before a [`Participant`] is ready to
//! process them. [`Participant`]s can be given messages at any time; when
//! messages are received early, they are stored in memory by the library and
//! retrieved and processed at the appropriate time.
//!
//! A sub-protocol session automatically progresses between rounds; the calling
//! application does not have to track where within a session the protocol
//! execution is at a given time.

//! [^abort]: In a protocol that offers identifiable abort,
//! malicious participants may cause the protocol to abort but
//! honest participants are able to identify the malicious party (and take
//! recovery actions). In a protocol that offers selective abort, malicious
//! participants may cause _some_ honest participants to abort, but any
//! non-aborting honest participants have the correct output. This is weaker
//! because honest parties do not identify malicious parties and there is
//! inconsistency across honest parties on whether an abort happened or not.
