//! Security parameter definitions.
//!
//! This module defines security parameters that ensure the protocol satisfies
//! 80-bit statistical security and 112-bit computational security (the paper claims
//! 128-bit computational security, but NIST's Recommendation for Key Management \[1\]
//! advises that a 2048-bit Paillier modulus only provides 112 bits of computational security).
//!
//! Values are sourced from throughout the paper \[2\], especially Figure 1 (page 5) and Table 2
//! (page 69).
